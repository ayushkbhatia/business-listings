# Handoff 4 — progress

Working state for an autonomous run through `docs/roadmap-handoff-4.md`. Updated at the end
of every PR. If you are picking this up cold, read the roadmap first, then this.

**Cadence:** branch → build → `pnpm verify` and `pnpm test:e2e` green locally → PR → CI green
→ squash merge → next step. No direct pushes to `main`.

**Standing authorisation (2026-08-26):** merge own PRs when CI is green and start the next
sprint without asking, through to the end of the handoff.

## Next

**Step 5 — commercials `[4g]` `[12e]`.**

- `[4g]` revenue and MRR movement. The decomposition is unspecified — new / expansion /
  contraction / churn is the usual four and `Waterfall` exists — so it is a stated assumption.
- `[12e]` entitlements as data with grandfathering, dunning D0/D3/D7/D14, VAT export,
  invoices and credits.
- **Grandfathering does not work.** `Subscription.entitlementSnapshot` exists, its doc comment
  promises it, all three writers store `{ planId, capturedAt }` with no cap values, and
  nothing reads it. "Apply to existing" has nothing to switch off until this is fixed.
- Criterion 10 is the negative one: dunning must never delete a listing or remove a badge.
  `StatCard` hardcodes `font-serif` in both branches and admin is no-serif, so it takes a prop.

Then steps 6–8 per the roadmap: the storefront builder, content ops, the acceptance pass.

## Carried forward

- **PDPL requests and API keys have tables and no screens.** `/admin/compliance` and
  `/admin/api` are still `later`. Small, and neither is blocking.
- **Staff role management** (`/admin/staff`) is not built. `staff.manage` is a capability with
  no service behind it.
- **The dedupe candidate list has no scheduled rescan.** It runs on demand from the screen.
- **Merged listings are filtered out of `/b/[slug]` and the call list**, and not yet out of
  search, category pages or the sitemap.

## Carried forward

- **The taxonomy and spec-library screens are read-only.** `editCategory` and
  `publishVersionWithField` are built, tested and unwired to a form.
- **The dedupe candidate list has no scheduled rescan.** `findCandidates` runs on demand from
  the screen. It belongs on the hourly job beside the metrics, in a later step.
- **A merged listing is excluded from the public surface by `mergedIntoId`**, and the four
  `/b/[slug]` routes now redirect. Other surfaces that list businesses — search, category
  pages, the sitemap — do not yet filter merged listings out.

## Blocked on the user, and routed around

None of these stop a step; each narrows one.

- **`stores.businesslistings.me` does not exist**, and there is no Vercel API token. Step 6's
  certificate issuance is a platform operation, not app code. Building behind a
  `CertificateIssuer` port with a fake, in the shape of `lib/billing/provider.ts`, so the five
  DNS states are provable and the certificate half is honestly marked as not-yet-live.
- **The contrast decision**, pinned since handoff 1. Criterion 12 reads as "clean outside the
  documented token pairings" until it is settled — the handoff-1-to-3 convention, stated
  plainly in the acceptance walk rather than implied.
- **`service_role` key rotation.**

## Decisions taken without asking, and why

Recorded so they can be reversed cheaply rather than discovered.

- **Step 1 split into two PRs.** 1a was already 3,000 lines and carried the checkpoint.
- **`SpecTemplateVersion` dropped.** `SpecTemplate` already has `version`, `status` and a
  unique `(categoryId, version)`, so a new version is a new row. The roadmap's proposal was
  redundant.
- **`/admin/queue/conflict/:id` added** as a sibling of `/admin/queue/:id`, recorded in
  `docs/routes.md`. One detail route could not carry two different decisions.

## Conventions this run relies on

- Every staff mutation goes through `staffMutation`, which refuses a blank reason and a
  subject-dependent capability with no subject check.
- A metric with no table returns `null` and reads "not measurable yet". Never zero.
- Fixture failures throw. `if (!result.ok) return` turns a test green with no assertions run.
- The seed truncates `user`, so `pnpm db:seed` invalidates saved Playwright sessions —
  re-run `--project=setup` after seeding.
- A filtered Playwright run applies `-g` to every project including `setup`. The acceptance
  walk mints sessions unfiltered first, then passes `--no-deps`.
