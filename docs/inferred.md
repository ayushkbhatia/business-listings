# Inferred decisions, pending the design canvas

`docs/design-system.md` names **`Business Listings Design System.dc.html`** as the
authority for chapters §02–§06 — every component, every state, drawn. That file
has not been supplied. `docs/tokens.css` covers §01 and §09.1; nothing covers the
component chapters.

Everything below was derived from what the shipped documents do say: the
prose rules in `docs/design-system.md`, the non-negotiables in `CLAUDE.md`, the
route table, the data model, and the accessibility floor. Each entry names what
was decided and what it was decided from, so diffing against the canvas is
mechanical rather than a re-read.

`pnpm matrix` prints the permission matrix, which is tracked the same way.

## Tier 1 primitives — checkpoint 4

### Button, the five variants
`primary` · `secondary` · `ghost` · `danger` · `link`

The README names `danger` explicitly and the design system says moss marks
action and nothing else. Primary is moss; secondary is the outlined form for a
second action beside it; ghost is the toolbar and table form with no border;
link is the inline text form. Five was the stated count, not five I chose.

### Button, the four sizes
`sm` 32px · `md` 36px · `lg` 44px · `xl` 52px

The accessibility floor is 32px on desktop and 44px on mobile, so `sm` sits on
the desktop floor exactly and `lg` on the mobile one. `xl` is for a single
full-width mobile action. Anything under 32px belongs to an IconButton inside a
table row, where the row is the target.

### Loading keeps the label
A loading button shows a spinner *beside* its label rather than replacing it,
and keeps `aria-busy` rather than only `disabled`. Derived from the voice rule
that a control should say what it is doing; a bare spinner where "Send quote"
was is a control that stopped explaining itself mid-request.

### Control heights
`sm` 32px · `md` 36px · `lg` 44px, shared by Input, Select, SearchField,
Stepper and TimePair through one shell so they cannot drift apart.

### Selection treatment
1.5px moss border plus `--moss-wash` fill, never a shadow. Stated in
design-system §"Interaction rules that are easy to get wrong". Applied to
SegmentedControl's selected segment and MultiSelect's chips.

### Dashed borders
Only FileDrop's idle state. Stated: dashed means "empty, add or drop something
here" and nothing else. The moment a file exists the border goes solid.

### Toggle is a switch, and can be pending
`role="switch"`, not a checkbox, because the announcement is on/off. It carries
a `pending` state because the design system says a toggle applies immediately —
which means it can fail, and a switch that silently reverts three seconds later
is worse than one that never moved. The pending state is inferred; the
apply-immediately rule is stated.

### Textarea's counter is soft
Typing past the limit is allowed and flagged rather than blocked. A hard
`maxLength` silently swallows a paste, and a buyer pasting a requirement out of
an email should see it truncated by their own hand. Counter goes muted → warn in
the last tenth → bad once over.

### Select is native, MultiSelect is not
A native `<select>` gets the platform picker, which is what a buyer on a phone
in a warehouse already knows. No platform multi-select is worth putting in front
of anyone, so that one is ours.

### MultiSelect shows a filter box past eight options
Threshold is a prop with a default of 8. Six certifications do not need a search
box; forty areas do.

### RangeSlider is two native inputs
Rather than a div with drag handlers. Arrow keys, Home and End work for free,
and the current pair is always rendered as text — a slider whose position is the
only readout is unusable for anyone who cannot see it.

### Focus ring
`--focus-ring` on everything, `--focus-ring-danger` on a danger control. Stated
in the accessibility floor: 2px offset ring in moss, or in the status colour on
a danger control.

### `data-force` pinned states
A gallery-only affordance. `hover` and `focus` are overridden as custom variants
in `globals.css` so a specimen can be pinned with `data-force="hover"` and show
the real styles. A gallery that hand-copies a hover style lies the first time
the variant changes. Nothing in production sets the attribute.

## Still unknown, and not guessed

- The exact component inventory of §02 beyond the eighteen names in the README.
- Whether the canvas draws states this build does not have (a Button `active`
  press state, for one — currently the hover treatment carries it).
- Whether `xl` is a real Button size or whether the fourth size is smaller than
  `sm`. If the canvas has a 28px table-row button, `sm` moves down and a new
  size joins the top.
- Icon set. These are drawn to a 16px grid at 1.5 stroke to sit with Geist at
  13px; the canvas may specify a different family.
